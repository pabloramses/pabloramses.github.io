Today I handed in my <a href="{{ page.cv_pdf | prepend: 'assets/pdf/ST955_2155269_Dissertation.pdf' | relative_url}}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Master's thesis</a>, which provides an introduction to Piece-wise Deterministic Markov Processes and their usage for sampling from Bayesian Neural Networks. A post with more details will be uploaded soon!
