PhD student in Statistics at University of Warwick. Currently working on the use of Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) methods and their application to Bayesian Inference, with a particular interest in Bayesian Neural Networks. 

Before embarking on a PhD, I graduated from the University of Warwick with an MSc in Statistics and from the University of Oviedo (Spain) with a BSc in Mathematics.
